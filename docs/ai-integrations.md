# AI Integration Roadmap

## Overview

Obwob's AI integration strategy focuses on transforming raw participant responses into actionable insights while maintaining the ethical standards and accessibility that define the platform. The approach prioritises practical, high-value features that can be implemented with current technology while building toward more sophisticated capabilities.

## Technical Approach

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Security

**Why RAG**: Ensures sensitive participant data remains secure while enabling AI processing
- **Data Isolation**: Responses processed in isolated environments without external model training
- **Contextual Grounding**: AI insights based on actual participant responses, not hallucinated content
- **Auditability**: Clear traceability between AI outputs and source responses

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation

**Anthropic's Model Context Protocol**: Structured format for rich context interaction with LLMs
- **Modular Context**: Each response as a referenced block for precise attribution
- **Incremental Updates**: Add new responses to context without reprocessing entire datasets
- **Grounded Outputs**: AI insights directly linked to specific participant responses

**Example MCP Structure**:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Analyse sentiment patterns across these workshop responses"}
  ],
  "context": {
    "blocks": [
      {"id": "resp_1", "timestamp": "2025-03-15T14:23:00Z", "content": "The exercise helped me understand my creative process"},
      {"id": "resp_2", "timestamp": "2025-03-15T14:25:00Z", "content": "I felt overwhelmed by the group discussion"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Processing Pipeline

**1. Ingestion Layer**
```python
# Simplified response processing flow
def process_response(response_data):
    # Validate and clean input
    cleaned_response = sanitize_input(response_data)
    
    # Generate embeddings for clustering
    embedding = generate_embedding(cleaned_response.text)
    
    # Perform sentiment analysis
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(cleaned_response.text)
    
    # Store with metadata
    store_processed_response(cleaned_response, embedding, sentiment)
```

**2. AI Analysis Layer**
```python
# MCP-structured summarization
def generate_summary(event_responses):
    context_blocks = [
        {"id": f"resp_{r.id}", "content": r.text, "timestamp": r.created_at}
        for r in event_responses
    ]
    
    mcp_payload = {
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize key themes from these responses"}],
        "context": {"blocks": context_blocks}
    }
    
    return call_claude_with_mcp(mcp_payload)
